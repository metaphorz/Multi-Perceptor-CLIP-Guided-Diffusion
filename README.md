# Multi-Perceptor-CLIP-Guided-Diffusion
Minor fork of Peter Baylies Google Colab
The main changes from the original:
1. Start mounting Google Drive (GD)
2. Create a directory tree there to hold everything (GD/MP_CLIP_GD_Baylies).
3. Clone Augmented_CLIP
4. Assumes all pretrained models (eg .pt, .pth) are stored in GD under "pretrained/"
5. Modify the image saving directory: images will appear under GD/MP_CLIP_GD_Baylies/images
